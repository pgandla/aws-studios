## [Migration](https://youtu.be/Plsy7GSqX-0)
- Assessment - Planning - Migrations - Opearations
- Use case
	- Agent-based - ClondEndure - large np.of machine
	- Agentless - SMS - large of on-prem VMs
	- vMotion for VMWare to move VMs to AWS cloud
	- CloudEndure DR for disaster recovery.
## [Migration HUB](https://youtu.be/PVyWqViXieY)
- Track the migration status
- Discovery using AWS ADS
- Application descovery service
- Agents collect the data to get the insights about data center
- Analyze the data to estimate EC2 costs.


## Application Discovery Service
- Planning by collecting usage and configuration data
- Grouping applications
- Use Athena, QuickSIght to analyze the data.
- Agentless
	- Install connector(OVA file) on vCenter
	- Collect hostnames, IPs, CPU, RAM, Disk I/O
	- Can’t collect VMs processes
	- Only VMs
- Agent-based
	- Install agent on VMs
	- Collects time-series, network, prcesses
	- Server setup
- Data discovery
	- Enable Athena from Migration Hub
	- Time-series analyze
	- QuickSight to visualize the data


##  [Server Migration Service](https://youtu.be/_SpRpC2Ez9c)
- Agentless - VMWare, HyperV, Azure workloads
- Cost-effective solution
- Multi-server application migrations
- AMI encryption
- Integrated with migration hub
- Automation
- Incremental replication of live server volumes
- ServerMigrationConnector policy to use.
- Download and setup connector 
- Import server catalog
- Create replication job
- License - AWS/BYOL
- Create a instance from EMI
- Applications - group all apps and launch as a single stack
- Can’t use applications discovered by ADS
- Can’t edit CloudFormation template generated by SMS
- Use case - Migrate Sharepoint to AWS
- Best practices 
	-  VM pre-reqs
	- Close to hypervisor and multiple connectors
	- PrivateLink with DirectConnect 

## Data Migration
- Storage gateway
	- File gateway
	- Tape gateway
	- Volume gateway

##[Direct Connect](https://youtu.be/-IeVqABxIVU)
	- dedicated network connection
	- Reduce network costs
	- increase bandwidth
	- Both public and private VIFs
	- Create connection 
	- Letter of Authorization(LoA) to APN
	- Cross connect
	- Configure VIFs
	- 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps
	- Use case 
		- Large datasets
		- Realtime data feeds
		- Hybrid environments
	- Dedicated connections
		- AWS will setup the connection
		- Port speed - 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps
	- Hosted connections
		- APN partner will assist here
		- Port speed - 50 Mbps ~ 10 Gbps
	- Can’t change port speed once configured.
	- Link Aggregation group (LAG) to group multiple connections for redundancy.
	- Aggregates multiple connections at a single connect endpoint
	- Uses Link Aggregation Control Protocol LACP
	- All connections must be dedicated
	- Maximum 4 connections and should be on same bandwidth
	- All connections in a LAG must end at same endpoint
	- DirectConnect gateway: Multiple VPCs to signle connect endpoint
	- Global service
	- Virtual Gateway Association >> Direct Gateway >> VF >> Direct Connection >> Customer Network
	- Not transitive. Can’t connect VPGs.
